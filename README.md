# Predicting-Football-Match-Winners-With-Machine-Learning-And-Python

## Project description
In this project, I used machine learning to predict who will win football matches in the Premier League (EPL). 
I cleaned the EPL match data; identified missing values; created predictors and trained a machine learning model to predict the winner of each of the football matches.  

## Tools used

Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
